Main Menu:
- Create session name input
- join session name input
	- figure out where to save cross-level data, do some reseach (gs? pc? saving to actual files?)

Session lobby:
- Wire up player name to playerlist
- remove ping field
- add logic to session lobby to ensure equal(ish) teams

Gameplay level:
- iron out start of gameplay_level to use Game state values to assign spawn locations and teams
- adjust spawn locations per team so they have boat
- Non-host players can't drive boat (teleport into ground). Host works fine


leftoff:
- Try first:
	- On server connect in GM, check to see if GlobalGameInstance.ConnectorPlayerInfo is empty
	- If so, set flag "local testing" and alternate between spawning players between blue and red
- Continue adding the structs to C++ code (TeamOption and ConntectedPlayerInfo (previously PlayerInfo))
