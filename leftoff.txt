- replicate teamoptions selection per player
- Create game state for main menu (do we need different game states per level? maybe just use one GS for whole game)
- Remove spaghettio code in main menu PC
- continute watching video to connect dots between main menu and session lobby
	- this includes the invite path and join path (maybe we don't have a join path?)
	- use the player count from CreateSession in sessionlobby
- add logic to session lobby to ensure equal(ish) teams
- iron out start of gameplay_level to use Game state values to assign spawn locations and teams

- adjust spawn locations per team so they have boat
