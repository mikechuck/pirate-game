Main Menu:
- Create session name input
- join session name input
	- figure out where to save cross-level data, do some reseach (gs? pc? saving to actual files?)

Session lobby:
- Wire up player name to playerlist
- remove ping field
- add logic to session lobby to ensure equal(ish) teams

Gameplay level:
- non-server boat moves faster it seems. Check speeds?
- weapon swap replication
- start on gun overhaul
	- set a slow fire rate
	- add a kickback aniumation
	- add a gun sound
	- add smoke
	- make bullet animate to puff and dissapear when hitting something
	- hit marker sound? (activate when hitting another player or boat)
	- add smoke to shoot
	- add recoil to shoot
	- add reload circle to hud for shoot
- do same thing for cannon ^
- Add randomized noat angling/bobbing
- fix normals on the boat rope. Might need to redo, depending on how it was made. Maybe activate a "both side" mode?
- Move weapon swapping logic to SRPC
- Items:
	- Change weapons to not show realtime weapon, but a hud-only version. So we don't have to worry about angles, views etc


leftoff:
- Client movement is stuttery on the boat. How do we fix that? replication?
	- I think I need client side prediction for player as well as the boat to make things smooth. Movement is fine as long as it's smooth https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/m8dw4x/walking_on_a_moving_ship_sea_of_thieves_space/
- fix control cannons
	- gun only disapears on the server
	- add cannon reload times logic
- Add reload UI to gun and cannon
- fix weapon swapping (move to server-authoritative)
- Override pirate hat material to team color on spawn
- add ui to indicate "enemy" when pointing at other team (line trace), change crosshair to red
- move item overhaul (separate 1st person and 3rd person item views)
	- make sure item rotation (esp vertical) is replicated
- add gun recoil animations, muzzle smoke
- add delay on sound for actual distance delay



MP sound design:
- play sound on client
- send to server rpc "broadcast sound" with cue as input
- on server gamemode, send a broadcast "play this sound at this location"
- DONE all server players subscribe to gamemode "broadcast sound"
- client rpc: play this sound at this location 
- add sound delay: speed of sound is: 34300 units/s

Gameplay HUD:
- Controls weather to show PlayerHud or PauseMenu
- Be able to spawn menus on top of PlayerHud (like in-game menus for crates, inventories, maps overlay, etc)



LEFTOFF:
- finish replicating rotatations to server and other clients. Manually adjust rotate character components to imitate controller rotation
