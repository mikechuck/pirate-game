Main Menu:
- Create session name input
- join session name input
	- figure out where to save cross-level data, do some reseach (gs? pc? saving to actual files?)

Session lobby:
- Wire up player name to playerlist
- remove ping field
- add logic to session lobby to ensure equal(ish) teams

Gameplay level:
- iron out start of gameplay_level to use Game state values to assign spawn locations and teams
- adjust spawn locations per team so they have boat




- Need to add "add change player controller" handler to GM Session (maybe GM Gameplayer) as well, to handle switching controllers between levels

- in game mode, create function that is going to spawn all players
	- Function: grab player starts for each team, save them to an array
	- Function: spawn player
		- input: player controller
		- first "get controlled pawn" to see if the player controller already controls one
			- if so, destroy actor
		- spawn actor from class
		- possess new actor by input controller
- in PC, invoke the GM functions
	- invoke initiate the SpawnPlayer from client, using a server rpc function 


leftoff:
- Can possess players but can't move, need to figure that out
- spawn each player to a team location
