Main Menu:
- Create session name input
- join session name input
	- figure out where to save cross-level data, do some reseach (gs? pc? saving to actual files?)

Session lobby:
- Wire up player name to playerlist
- remove ping field
- add logic to session lobby to ensure equal(ish) teams

Gameplay level:
- non-server boat moves faster it seems. Check speeds?
- weapon swap replication
- start on gun overhaul
	- set a slow fire rate
	- add a kickback aniumation
	- add a gun sound
	- add smoke
	- make bullet animate to puff and dissapear when hitting something
	- hit marker sound? (activate when hitting another player or boat)
	- add smoke to shoot
	- add recoil to shoot
	- add reload circle to hud for shoot
- do same thing for cannon ^
- Add randomized noat angling/bobbing
- fix normals on the boat rope. Might need to redo, depending on how it was made. Maybe activate a "both side" mode?
- Move weapon swapping logic to SRPC
- Items:
	- Change weapons to not show realtime weapon, but a hud-only version. So we don't have to worry about angles, views etc


leftoff:
- Client movement is stuttery on the boat. How do we fix that? replication?
	- I think I need client side prediction for player as well as the boat to make things smooth. Movement is fine as long as it's smooth https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/m8dw4x/walking_on_a_moving_ship_sea_of_thieves_space/
- fix control cannons
	- gun only disapears on the server
	- add cannon reload times logic
- Add reload UI to gun and cannon
- fix weapon swapping (move to server-authoritative)
- Override pirate hat material to team color on spawn
- add ui to indicate "enemy" when pointing at other team (line trace), change crosshair to red
- move item overhaul (separate 1st person and 3rd person item views)
	- make sure item rotation (esp vertical) is replicated
- add gun recoil animations, muzzle smoke
- add delay on sound for actual distance delay



MP sound design:
- play sound on client
- send to server rpc "broadcast sound" with cue as input
- on server gamemode, send a broadcast "play this sound at this location"
- DONE all server players subscribe to gamemode "broadcast sound"
- client rpc: play this sound at this location 
- add sound delay: speed of sound is: 34300 units/s

Gameplay HUD:
- Controls weather to show PlayerHud or PauseMenu
- Be able to spawn menus on top of PlayerHud (like in-game menus for crates, inventories, maps overlay, etc)



NEXT:
- Figure out why build doesn't possess character on start
- Start on health system 
	- give players health
	- add to UI (bar on the top?)
	- hook up player name to UI
	- add logic to decrease hp of player on SERVER hit
	- add a screen indication that player is hit (quick flash/dim, quick camera shake, etc)
	- When health hits 0, initiate a death sequence for that player for all clients

- Sounds
	- new shoot sound (more of a pop sound)
	- add hit sound 
		- hitmarker for shooting player
		- hit sound on object/player for all players
	- add muzzle smoke and hit smoke (simple fast expanding circles that disappear)

- Death sequence
	- Fade screen to black "Argh you died"
	- "Press button to respawn"

- Respawn logic
	- reuse initial spawn logic for spawning specific player, possessing, etc

- UI
	- Show other player health when close enouigh (line trace interating with large collider around player)
		- billboard
		- friendlies always show health
		- enemies only show when close enough
	- Change color of reticle when aiming at an enemy
	
- When player is driving boat, do client side prediction like player_base
- When a boat is not being controlled, just multicast out it's position

LEFTOFF:
- Continue to figure out how to hide player mesh on listen server
	- figure out "is this instance controlled locally"
	- worked before, not sure why it doesn't anymore....
- boat hull doesn't have "visibility" collition for line traces and bullet hit.
	- add to water as well for splashes
