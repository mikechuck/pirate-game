Main Menu:
- Create session name input
- join session name input
	- figure out where to save cross-level data, do some reseach (gs? pc? saving to actual files?)

Session lobby:
- Wire up player name to playerlist
- remove ping field
- add logic to session lobby to ensure equal(ish) teams

Gameplay level:
- redo the player HUD (remove ui from cp_character_base and move to actual HUD blueprint)
- fix weird water artifact (low priority)
- non-server boat moves faster it seems. Check speeds?
- Client player sees own body teleport to world origin, not visible on server
- Player models dissapear when being parented to boat
- weapon swap replication
- start on gun overhaul
	- set a slow fire rate
	- add a kickback aniumation
	- add a gun sound
	- add smoke
	- make bullet animate to puff and dissapear when hitting something
	- hit marker sound? (activate when hitting another player or boat)
- do same thing for cannon ^
- Add randomized noat angling/bobbing
- fix normals on the boat rope. Might need to redo, depending on how it was made. Maybe activate a "both side" mode?

leftoff:
- Client triggers a shoot for the host as well. Also shoots twice. Sound doesn't come from host on client view either
- fix "stop control boat" flow
- fix control cannons
- maybe decrease the water wave height for now to test



MP sound design:
- play sound on client
- send to server rpc "broadcast sound" with cue as input
- on server gamemode, send a broadcast "play this sound at this location"
- DONE all server players subscribe to gamemode "broadcast sound"
- client rpc: play this sound at this location 
- add sound delay: speed of sound is: 34300 units/s

Gameplay HUD:
- Controls weather to show PlayerHud or PauseMenu
- Be able to spawn menus on top of PlayerHud (like in-game menus for crates, inventories, maps overlay, etc)
