Main Menu:

- Items:
	- Change weapons to not show realtime weapon, but a hud-only version. So we don't have to worry about angles, views etc

MP sound design:
- play sound on client
- send to server rpc "broadcast sound" with cue as input
- on server gamemode, send a broadcast "play this sound at this location"
- DONE all server players subscribe to gamemode "broadcast sound"
- client rpc: play this sound at this location 
- add sound delay: speed of sound is: 34300 units/s

Gameplay HUD:
- Controls weather to show PlayerHud or PauseMenu
- Be able to spawn menus on top of PlayerHud (like in-game menus for crates, inventories, maps overlay, etc)
