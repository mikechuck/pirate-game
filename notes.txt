Client side prediction
- at start gameplay (client and server), start "StateUpdateCount"
- set Client loop: every 100ms:
	- increment StateUpdateCount
	- send an update call to the ServerRPC with data:
		- StateUpdateCount
		- new information (position)
		- 
- setup a queue data structure on server
- every tick on the server interval:
	- As fast as it can, pull first item in the queue (oldest) and process


- get confirmed position from array using incoming index
- loop through map until end (length)
- maths the latest position that was sent to the sever and apply it
